# COMP-6411
Comparative study of programming languages

The objective in this course is to examine the constructs and features that define many of the more common program languages, and a few of the not so common ones as well.  In particular, we see how basic language design and implementation choices ultimately affect the robustness, safety, readability, flexibility, and power of the software generated by application developers. Topics include:
Program Scope and bindings
Data types
Expressions
Subprograms
Abstraction and encapsulation
Object oriented programming
Concurrency
Functional languages

We try develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the advantages and disadvantages of the core features of computer programming languages.
